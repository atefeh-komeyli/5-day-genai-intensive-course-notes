## 📅 Day 1: Foundations of Generative AI

### 🎯 Overview
This section introduces the core principles behind Generative AI, with a focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Topics covered include:

- **What is Generative AI and why it matters**  
- **Key milestones and model evolution** (GPT, PaLM, Gemini, etc.)
- **Architecture and components** of LLMs
- **Training process**: Pre-training, fine-tuning, and RLHF
- **Basic prompting techniques** (zero-shot, Chain-of-Thought, etc.)
- **Sample applications**: Summarization, translation, coding, etc.

## 📅 Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores

### 🎯 Overview
Day 2 dives into **embeddings** and **vector stores**, foundational tools in modern AI workflows — especially for tasks like **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Key points include:

- How embeddings turn data (text, images, structured info) into **meaningful vector representations**  
- The role of **vector databases** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) in fast, high-dimensional similarity searches  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and how embeddings help LLMs access external knowledge  
- The importance of **joint embeddings** for multimodal data (text + images)  
- **Training and fine-tuning** approaches, plus real-world use cases

## 📅 Day 3: Agents & AI Autonomy

### 🎯 Overview
Day 3 introduces **AI agents**, which act autonomously to **observe, plan, and act** on their environment. They differ from traditional models by continuously assessing conditions and proactively making decisions. Topics include:

- **Agent Architecture**: The **Model** as decision-maker, **Tools & Extensions** for external APIs, and an **Orchestration Layer** to manage workflows  
- **Targeted Learning Techniques**: In-context learning, retrieval-based methods, and fine-tuning for domain tasks  
- **Agentic RAG**: Combining AI agents with retrieval-augmented generation for dynamic data lookups  
- **Multi-Agent Systems** & **AgentOps**: Coordinating specialized agents at scale and establishing DevOps-like practices for agent monitoring  
- **Real-World Applications**: From **automotive AI** to enterprise automation and the concept of agents as “digital employees”

## 📅 Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs & Specialized AI

### 🎯 Overview
Day 4 focuses on customizing LLMs for **specific industries** such as **healthcare** and **cybersecurity**, highlighting how specialized models can address nuanced challenges. Key points include:

- **Why Domain-Specific?** Leveraging LLMs tailored to high-stakes fields (e.g., Med LMs, secm) to achieve better accuracy and context awareness  
- **In-Context & Fine-Tuning Methods**: Adapt models to unique data (e.g., patient records, threat logs) and continually refine with expert feedback  
- **Evaluation & Safety**: Implement governance, retrospective analysis, and compliance for sensitive domains  
- **Future Potential**: Predictive modeling for disease trends or security threats, plus expansion to finance, law, and more

## 📅 Day 5: Operationalizing Generative AI with MLOps on Vertex AI

### 🎯 Overview
Day 5 ties everything together by addressing **deployment, monitoring, and governance** of Generative AI systems. Using **Vertex AI** and MLOps practices, teams can streamline GenAI from prototype to production. Core topics include:

- **5 Phases of GenAI Lifecycle**: Discover, Develop, Evaluate, Deploy, Govern  
- **Chaining & Prompt Engineering**: Managing multi-model pipelines and treating prompts as both **data** and **code**  
- **Evaluation & Monitoring**: Balancing subjective quality with automated checks, plus multi-level logging  
- **AgentOps & Governance**: Extending MLOps to support autonomous agents and ensuring trustworthiness, version control, and compliance

## ðŸ“… Day 1: Foundations of Generative AI

### ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This section introduces the core principles behind Generative AI, with a focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Topics covered include:

- **What is Generative AI and why it matters**  
- **Key milestones and model evolution** (GPT, PaLM, Gemini, etc.)
- **Architecture and components** of LLMs
- **Training process**: Pre-training, fine-tuning, and RLHF
- **Basic prompting techniques** (zero-shot, Chain-of-Thought, etc.)
- **Sample applications**: Summarization, translation, coding, etc.

## ðŸ“… Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores

### ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Day 2 dives into **embeddings** and **vector stores**, foundational tools in modern AI workflows â€” especially for tasks like **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Key points include:

- How embeddings turn data (text, images, structured info) into **meaningful vector representations**  
- The role of **vector databases** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) in fast, high-dimensional similarity searches  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and how embeddings help LLMs access external knowledge  
- The importance of **joint embeddings** for multimodal data (text + images)  
- **Training and fine-tuning** approaches, plus real-world use cases
